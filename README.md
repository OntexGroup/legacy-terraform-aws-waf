Creates a WAF and associates it with an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Creates the following resources:

* Web Application Firewall (WAF)
* Links F5-managed OWASP rules for WAF to block common attacks
* Creates rule for WAF to block requests by source IP Address (**Note**: the list of blocked IPs are not managed by this module)
* Creates rule for WAF to block requests by path (as found in URI)
* Creates rule for WAF to allow requests by host (as found in HTTP Header)
* Attaches WAF to Application Load Balancer (ALB)

## Usage

```hcl
module "waf" {
  source = "trussworks/waf/aws"

  environment                         = "${var.environment}"
  associate_alb                       = true
  alb_arn                             = "${module.alb_web_containers.alb_arn}"
  wafregional_rule_f5_id              = "${var.wafregional_rule_id}"
  ips_disallow                        = "${var.waf_ips_diallow}"
  regex_path_disallow_pattern_strings = "${var.waf_regex_path_disallow_pattern_strings}"
  regex_host_allow_pattern_strings    = "${var.waf_regex_host_allow_pattern_strings}"
  ip_rate_limit                       = 2000
}
```
